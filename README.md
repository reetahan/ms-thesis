# ms-thesis

Code for simulations as part of thesis results will be uploaded here.

The main code can be found in the source folder, where running and editing the driver.py file
will run simulations (using the Plots, Experiments, Conversion and Graphs classes).

Simulation plots will go in the output folder. Slides and PDFs will go in the doc folder.
